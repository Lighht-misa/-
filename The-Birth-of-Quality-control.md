# The Birth of Quality control  

## Article  

    In the 1920s,a young enginner named Watler Shem conducted a detailed analysis of manufacting progresses at Wester Electric.Though careful inspection of production data,he noticed that silmilar varintions occurred at regular intervals.This obsvervation led him to organize his findings into a revolutionary account of statistical qualiity control.  

    The particulary challenge he faced was how to regulate production varibility in an economical way.At that time,quality checks were expensive and often interrupted the workflow.His current project aimed to find a better method that would not bear heavily on production costs.After analyzing counteless production records,he developed control charts that could qualify whether a progress was stable.  

    This economic approach was particularly valuable for industies seeking freedom from costly inspections.His method allowed manufactures to compare actual output with expected ranges and treat variations statistically.Contrary to general belief that qulity required extensive testing,he proved that regular monitoring of key points could yield setter results.  

    HIs system became tthe foundation for modren quality regulations and helped recover significant costs for manufacturers.TThe organization of production progress through statistical methods represented an economic breakthrough comparable technical inventions.It cared many industries of wasterful practices and established new standards for manufacturing excellence.
