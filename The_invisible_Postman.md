   In the early 1970s,computer networks were like separate islands.A machine in one network could not speak to another.Each company had its own system,adn users could not rely on any reliable method for communication.This lack of standards became a major barrier to progress.  

   Two reachers,Vint and Bob,took the responbsibility to solve this problem.They needed a system where every data packet would contain not just information,but aslo addressing details.Most important,the receiving computer needed to respond with a response confirming the packet arrived safely.  

   Their breakthrough was a set of rules called TCP/IP.In this system,each computer had a unique address.Data sent from one address would corrsepond to a speific destination.The corresponding protocol ensured packet woule be reassembled correctly.Their work involved long correspondence with technical challenges.  

   This invention brought great benefit to the digital world.It established a reliable foundation that could contain all kinds of data.The pace of internet development accelerated rapidly.Today,this system remains the invisible companion to all our online acctivites.
