  In 1971,a young engineer named Tom was working on a project for a reserach company called BBN.His responsibility was to improve communication methods within the growing APPANET network.While examining the system,he noticed an interesting trend:researchers preferred different methods to correspond with each other,but no standard system exsisted.  

  Tom decided to creat something new.He wanted to develop a reliable way for people to exchange messages directly between computers.The pace of his work was steady,and he had to rely on his own ingenuity since no companion could accompany him in this unexplored territory.He preferred a simple solution that would contain both the messagee and the address in one digital container.  
  
  His breakthrough came when he created a program that allowed messages to respond to specific user index numbers.The first email system require users to correspond through a simple syntax:username@hostname.This corresponding relationship between user and machine became the foundation of electronic correspondence.  

  The immdeiate benefit was clear-reachers could now exchange information rapidly.What began as a small experiments started a trend that would transform golbal communication.Today,as we rely on instant messaging,we own this convenience to Tom's work.The eamil system he created continues to be reliable companion in our digital lives.
